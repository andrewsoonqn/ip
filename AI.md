# AI Usage

## JSON Data Loading and Storing
* Tool used: Cursor
* Observations:
  * Although I did not provide much context, the LLM was able to accurately follow Jackson's API and implement correctly. I assume this is due to Jackson's API being mature and well-documented.
  * To deepen my understanding, I further conversed with the LLM to understand the API's syntax. 
  * This saved me time and effort to look for the API documentation.
